                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>Hey :P I was accepted to the University of Waterloo for Computer Engineering. That's pretty cool. I've always loved computers and technology in general so, fortunately, it was never really a question of what I wanted to do. I got the idea of blogging my experience from Jordyn Mindroff, an older computer engineering student at Waterloo; you can find his website <a href="https://mindorff.ca/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

                        <h2 class="sketchy-rotate-tiny-left">Admission Advice</h2>
                        <p>There is a lot I could say regarding the admission process, so I'll keep it to the information I wish I knew.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="sketchy-rotate-tiny-left">Senior Year</h2>
                        <p>Looking back, senior year felt like the longest yet somehow the shortest out of all the years. My first semester was nothing but academic classes and prerequisites for my top six. My daily routine turned into school, basketball, work, studying until I went to sleep, then waking up to repeat it the next day. While there was comfort in consistency, at some point it became incredibly boring as every day felt the exact same.</p>

                        <p>The saving grace during this period was definitely basketball. While I did complain from time to time about how many games or practices we had, I am so thankful that I was a part of the team since the beginning. The sport, and those I played it with, have given me memories and life lessons that I will undoubtedly carry forever. Regardless, I kept my head down and continued to work.</p>

                        <p>In contrast, my second semester went by incredibly quick. Since none of my classes were going to be included within my top six, I began to slack off. Senioritis got me - and it hit hard. Then I finally received my letter of acceptance in March. Honestly, I wasn't very excited. I think I gaslit myself into thinking I would get in no matter what and that it was just a matter of time. But this is when my slacking off peaked and my attendance fell off a cliff. I had 4 missed days in the first semester and over 40 during my second. During March-June I was basically a part-time student, and even that is generous. However, it was also the best semester of high school.</p>

                        <p>Give a high school student easy classes, good friends, unlimited time, a car, and you'll guarantee them some fun. I think everyone in the class realized that this was our last couple of months together - there was a sense of togetherness that definitely wasn't there before. The vibes were definitely much more chill. You only get one high school experience and I'm glad to say I made the most of it.</p>

                        <p>This summer, like many others, has been largely uneventful.</p>
